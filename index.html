                I am a passionate web developer from Andalucía, specializing in creating beautiful and efficient web applications. I have experience working at both large tech companies and small startups. While I focus on frontend development, I also understand the full stack, from UI design to backend APIs and databases.<br><br>
                Currently, I work at Flexxible, where I focus on [specific focus area, e.g., improving user experience, optimizing performance, etc.]. I am also working on [Project Name], an open-source [brief description of the project, e.g., headless CMS for blogging].<br><br>
                Outside of work, I enjoy [your hobbies, e.g., photography 📷, traveling 🧳, hiking 🥾, and learning new technologies 📚].
